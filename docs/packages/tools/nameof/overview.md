# @gtsc/nameof - Overview

The methods in this package are used to convert TypeScript class/type/property names to embedded strings, so that they are available to your JavaScript code at runtime.

This package is used in conjunction with the `@gtsc/nameof-transformer` package, without using the transformer for compilation you will end up with an error string embedded in your code instead of the runtime name you are expecting.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @gtsc/nameof
```
