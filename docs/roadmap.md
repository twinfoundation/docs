# Roadmap

This is the overview of TWIN development roadmap, showcasing our progress across different quarters and upcoming milestones.

## Q2 2025 - Main Development Progress

**TL;DR** Q2 2025 has been an intense quarter for the TWIN Development team, with considerable progress that has resulted in further development of the technology and the vision, while the team has been strengthened with new members and expertise. The fundamental achievements are:

### Fundamental Achievements

- **Architectural vision** has been updated / refined with feedback from development and partners. Further development of the TWIN Data Apps concept that has been captured in Draft #4 of the TWIN RA Whitepaper.

- DLT Connector for **IOTA Rebased** completed so the IOTA mainnet can be used as a verifiable registry for decentralized identities, Catalogue sync points, data commitments, etc.

- **TWIN Engine** developed as main Component Manager enabling **extensibility** through TWIN Data Apps. Main enabler of the **TWIN Node** as container of both TWIN Core Components and **TWIN Data Apps**.

- First version of the **TWIN Federated Catalogue** aligned with the Gaia-X Ontology. Four types of entries are supported: _Participants, Service Offerings, Data Resources and Data Space Connectors_ (Data Exchange Components).

- First version of the **decentralized storage component** that will be key for keeping multiple and synchronized copies of a Federated Catalogue or any Registry through a network of TWIN Nodes. Based on IPFS and IOTA Rebased.

- The **Documents Management component** has been consolidated and now every document is also an Auditable Item.

- Analysis of **W3C ODRL** and first stub of the **Rights Management component** and interfaces (PAP, PDP, etc.)

- Initial version of the **TWIN Data Space Connector** and first experiments with custom TWIN DS Connector Apps.

- The first major design of **TWIN ID** is now ready. This milestone sets up the fundamental systems for onboarding organizations in TWIN ecosystems. In addition, advanced features such as _verifiable credential_ template creation and issuance management are now possible to utilize in TWIN ID v0.5 as end-to-end flows.

- Next increment of the **TWIN Workbench** to support usage examples of the _Auditable Item Stream_, document management and data extraction, policy creation for the _rights management_ and fully IOTA Rebased usage.

### Other Refinements

- Improved JSON Schema validation and utilities
- Immutable Proofs standardized using W3C Data Integrity Proof
- Cost estimation analysis and deployment optimizations and automations for AWS
- New hires in the development team, especially for TWIN ID

## Next Steps

Please join us at the next TWIN Tech Webinar where we will provide additional details about our progress, you will have the opportunity to see the technology in action and to ask questions to the main developers.
