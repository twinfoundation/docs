# Introduction

TWIN is an open and interoperable software infrastructure and software platform for data integrity and self-sovereign data management. The TWIN open-source infrastructure constitutes a digital pipeline accessible to all parties involved in different global trade and value-chain ecosystems. Built upon robust, public, permissionless Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), TWIN leverages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials to ensure secure, transparent, and scalable data exchanges.

With its structured approach across Application, Data & Services, and Infrastructure layers, TWIN integrates smoothly with both legacy and modern systems through standardized APIs, supporting interoperability and minimizing integration complexities. At the heart of TWIN is a decentralized Trust Framework adhering to global standards from W3C, Gaia-X, and IDSA, enabling independent, verifiable, and private interactions. TWIN facilitates a trustworthy digital environment where data integrity, sovereignty, and efficiency drive frictionless collaboration across diverse trading networks.
