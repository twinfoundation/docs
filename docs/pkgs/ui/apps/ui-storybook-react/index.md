A deployment of this app can be found here [https://storybook-react.twindev.org](https://storybook-react.twindev.org)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

This will create a static version of the app in the `storybook-static` folder.
