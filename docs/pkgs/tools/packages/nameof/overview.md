# GTSC Nameof

The methods in this package are used to convert TypeScript class/type/property names to embedded strings, so that they are available to your JavaScript code at runtime.

This package is used in conjunction with the `@gtsc/nameof-transformer` package, without using the transformer for compilation you will end up with an error string embedded in your code instead of the runtime name you are expecting.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @gtsc/nameof
```

## Examples

Usage of the APIs is shown in the examples [examples.md](examples.md)

## Reference

Detailed reference documentation for the API can be found in [reference/globals.md](reference/globals.md)

## Changelog

The changes between each version can be found in [changelog.md](changelog.md)
