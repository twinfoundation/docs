# TWIN Docs

This is the main repository for the TWIN documentation.

## Installation

```shell
npm i
```

## Development

```shell
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```shell
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

The `preview` version is deployed to vercel when you perform changes on a branch. When the changes are merged to `main` the production version is deployed.

## Adding a new package group

To add a new package group modify `repos.json`, the order in the file determines the ordering on the published docs page.

## Patches

We use a patched version of docusaurus which reduces the overhead of asynchronously trying to build all the packages in one go, see the [./patches](./patches) folder.

The patch was generated by updating the code in node_modules and then running the following command.

```shell
npx patch-package @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs
```

The patch is installed, in the `postinstall` script in package.json.
